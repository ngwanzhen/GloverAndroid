# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project #4: Glover (Android)

Glover is a collision detection device and phone application that will notify your loved ones on your location when you are out cycling, skiing or even driving. The device should be attached somewhere that may sense the impact and this triggers your phone to send out an SMS to your designated emergency contact with your location and other health related details like blood type and allergies.

This project makes use of:

Hardware
* Arduino Uno
* Piezo element
* 1 Mohm resistor
* 9V battery
* Bluetooth module (HC-05/ HC-06)

Software
* React Native
* Bluetooth library to pair with hardware
* GPS library
* Native geolocation
* Communications library to send SMS


## Getting Started

To see a working version of the phone app, you will need

1. Go to [React Native documentations](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)
2. Click on 'Building Projects with Native Code' (Note: Target OS: Android)
3. Install dependencies
4. Clone this repo
5. Run ```yarn install``` and ```react-native run-android``` inside your React Native project folder

## User Stories

* User should be able to register and log-in subsequently
* Registration page will prompt user to key in health-related details and emergency contact
* Logged-in user should be able to start session that will trigger pairing of bluetooth device for crash detection and GPS for location sensing
* Upon collision, app will start a 10 seconds countdown that user can dismiss if false-alarm triggered by a bump on the road or a minor accident.
* If user is in a serious accident and is unable to dismiss the countdown, the app will then automatically send out a message to designated contact with information on location and previously provided health details.


## Challenges

1. Will locked phone disable sending SMS?
2. Will app running in background continually receive bluetooth data?
3. iOS doe not allow apps to send messages without prompting user to click 'send'


## Future Plans

1. Deployment to Play Store
2. Live-tracking of location & time to enable live updates to emergency contacts even without crash event. This will enable app to double up as a 'run-keeper' for cyclists, skiers, motorists or even joggers.
3. Implementation of accelerometer for increased accuracy
4. 'Forget Password' feature
5. Provide settings page to enable users to amend details such as emergency contact, allergies and health status
